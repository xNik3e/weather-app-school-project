<p>TThe aim of this project was to develop a weather application that could communicate with an external weather API and present weather information to the user in a visually appealing way. The presented solution was designed to accurately replicate the system application Weather found on OnePlus devices.</p>
<br>
<p>
The application features a scrollable home screen that allows users to easily switch between different cities with a single finger swipe. It displays information about the current weather conditions, as well as a weekly forecast presented in the form of an elegant chart. The home screen also provides the user with information about expected precipitation, wind direction and speed, visibility, pressure, humidity, and UV index. The background color changes according to the current weather conditions in the selected location.
</p>

<p>The city search function uses Fuzzy search, making it possible to find the desired location even with minor errors. The available geolocation module updates with changes in the user's location and allows them to choose the city closest to their current position.</p>
